            Pollution occurs when an amount of any substance or any form of energy is put into the environment at a rate faster than it can be dispersed or safely stored.
            <br>
            The term pollution can refer to both artificial and natural materials that are created, consumed, and discarded in an unsustainable manner.
            <br>
            pollution, the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment
            <br>
            at a rate faster than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. The major kinds of pollution, usually classified by 
            <br>
            environment, are air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Modern society is also concerned about specific types of pollutants, such as noise pollution, light pollution,
            <br>
            and plastic pollution. Pollution of all kinds can have negative effects on the environment and wildlife and often impacts human health and well-being.
            <br>
            There are various types of pollution chiefly arising as a result of anthropogenic causes. Also contributing to pollution is globalisation, where humanity’s constant need for natural 
            <br>
            resources has slowly started to change the face of the earth.
            <br>
            Though the quality of living has drastically improved, other new issues have risen that gradually impact human health and the environment. In this article, we shall explore the meaning,
            <br>
            causes and types of pollution. Also, we shall analyse the repercussions of pollution on human health and the environment.

            Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment, and it occurs in several major forms: air, water, soil, and noise pollution.
            <br>
            Air pollution is mainly caused by emissions from vehicles, factories, and burning of fossil fuels, which release toxic gases and particles into the atmosphere, leading to respiratory problems and climate change.
            <br>
            Water pollution happens when harmful chemicals, plastics, or sewage are discharged into rivers, lakes, and oceans, threatening marine life and contaminating drinking water. Soil pollution results from the excessive 
            <br>
            use of pesticides, industrial waste, and improper disposal of garbage, which reduces soil fertility and affects food safety. Noise pollution, caused by loud traffic, construction, and industrial activities, can lead to stress,
            <br>
            hearing loss, and disturbance in both humans and wildlife. All these types of pollution have serious impacts on the environment and human health, making pollution control an urgent global priority.
            <br>
            In conclusion, pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental challenges faced by the modern world. Its widespread impact on air, water, soil, and living beings continues to grow, affecting not just nature but also
            <br>
            the health and well-being of countless communities. As pollution spreads across regions and ecosystems, it leaves behind long-lasting consequences that are difficult to reverse. The ongoing presence of pollutants in our 
            <br>
            surroundings is a constant reminder of the damage being done to the planet and the delicate balance of life it supports.
